# ENCODING SECRET MESSAGES IN IMAGE FILES IN C++

## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a program capable of encoding secret messages in image files in a way that does not visibly alter the image itself. The is achieved by modifying the least significant bit of color/alpha values of individual pixels. Accesssing and modifying the pixel values is handled by [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML "Simple and Fast Multimedia Library").
